    <header><b>Fun Facts about me</b> </header>
    <p>
        <i>Since i started programming in 2021 after the pandemic, I have provided millions with the information,
            inspiration and connections they need to start, grow and manage a successful startup business theough my
            coding skills.
            <br>
            <p>I am a passionate developer, <b>Liam Abenger</b>,located in Nairobi, Kenya.
            <ol>
                <li><b>Education</b> - 2 degrees, Marketing and Financial Economics</li>
                <li><b>Job Experienve</b> - 8+years in marketing. Working in the intersection of marketing and
                    technology in large agencies and tech startups</li>


                <P><b>Why did I get into PROGRAMMING?</b> Unfortunately, during the pandemic most of the marketing
                    budget for big multinationals was slashed and there was a subsequent ripple effect in the industry.

                    Luckily, the company I was working for stormed through, but the pandemic had initiated a peculiar
                    thought in me: "I need a skill that could weather a storm ". In the next 2 months I did my research
                    on coding bootcamps in kenya and came across Moringa.

                    I talked to my boss about my interests in pursuing this long overdue passion of mine in coding. We
                    came to an agreement and we parted ways.

                    Now, here I am, standing tall and proud of the decision to apply because I got into prep. I know
                    prep is just a precursor to the core but I know the drive I have will see me get through into the
                    core programing. </P>
